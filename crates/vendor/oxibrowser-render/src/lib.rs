//! CSS-aware HTML rendering pipeline for OxiBrowser, backed by Blitz.
//!
//! This crate is the **only** place in the workspace that depends on the Blitz
//! rendering stack (Stylo CSS engine, Taffy layout, Parley text, vello_cpu
//! paint). It exposes a [`RenderDocument`] that wraps a Blitz [`BaseDocument`]
//! and produces real CSS-laid-out PNG screenshots — replacing the legacy
//! text-based bitmap-font renderer in `oxibrowser-core::css`.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! `BaseDocument` (Stylo-backed) is effectively `!Send`, so a `RenderDocument`
//! must live on a single thread. In the integrated design it is owned by the
//! JS thread alongside boa's `Context`; in this Phase-1 crate it is driven
//! directly by the caller. See `docs/designs/2026-08-07-blitz-rendering-integration.md`.

mod document;
mod paint;

// Re-export Blitz DOM types so downstream crates (oxibrowser-core) can walk the
// `BaseDocument` tree (returned by `RenderDocument::document()`) without adding
// a direct blitz-dom dependency.
